        <h1>About Conway's Game of Life</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to John Conway's "Game of Life"! This is a computer science
          classic from 1970, a program that simulates a cellular automaton
          (plural automata). It has connections to all kinds of different
          aspects of computer science and nature.
        </p>
        <h2>Origin</h2>
        <p>In late 1940, mathematician John von Neumann defined life as a creation (as a being or organism) which can reproduce itself and simulate a 
            Turing machine (donâ€™t worry, I will explain what a Turing machine is below). Von Neumann was thinking about an engineering solution which 
            would use electromagnetic components floating randomly in liquid or gas. This turned out not to be realistic with the technology available 
            at the time. Mathematician and scientist Stanislaw Ulam invented cellular automata (I explain this below), which were intended to simulate 
            von Neumann's theoretical electromagnetic constructions. Ulam discussed using computers to simulate his cellular automata in a two-dimensional 
            lattice in several papers. In parallel, von Neumann attempted to construct Ulam's cellular automaton. Although successful, he was busy with 
            other projects and left some details unfinished. His construction was complicated because it tried to simulate his own engineering design.

        <h2>About John Conway</h2>
        <p>John Horton Conway (December 26, 1937 - April 11, 2020) was an English mathematician 
            acitive in the theory of finite groups, knot theory, number theory, combinatorial game theory and
            coding theory. He made several contributions to the field of mathematics. </p>
        <p>Conway was born and raised in Liverpool, England. He worked first at the University of Cambridge, 
            then moved to the United States where he worked at Princeton University.
