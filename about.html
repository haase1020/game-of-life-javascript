        <h1>About Conway's Game of Life</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to John Conway's Game of Life! This is a computer science
          classic from 1970, a program that simulates a cellular automaton
          (plural is <em>automata</em>). It has connections to all kinds of different
          aspects of computer science and nature.
        </p>

        <h2>Origin</h2>
        <p> The Game of Life is an example of a <a href="#cellularautomata">cellular automata</a> and a zero-player game. It takes place on an infinite 
          two dimensional grid in which cells can be on (alive) or off (dead), and is defined by a set of results that determines the state of a cell
          given the state of its neighbors. This game first became popular in 1970 and has attracted lasting appeal. Although it is a simple program,
          it seems to exemplify emergent and self-organized behavior.

        <h2>How the Game Works</h2>
        <p>Conway chose his rules carefully, after considerable experimentation, to meet these criteria:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>There should be no explosive growth.</li>
            <li>There should exist small initial patterns with chaotic, unpredictable outcomes.</li>
            <li>There should be potential for von Neumann universal constructors (a self-replicating machine in a cellular automata (CA) environment).</li>
            <li>The rules should be as simple as possible, while adhering to the above constraints.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The game made its first public appearance in the October 1970 issue of Scientific American, in Martin Gardner's "Mathematical Games" column. 
            Theoretically, the Game of Life has the power of a universal Turing machine: anything that can be computed algorithmically can be computed 
            within the Game of Life. </p>

          <h2 id="cellularautomata">Cellular Automata</h2>
          <p>A cellular automaton (pl. cellular automata, abbrev. CA) is a discrete model studied in automata theory. Cellular automata are also called 
              cellular spaces, tessellation automata, homogeneous structures, cellular structures, tessellation structures, and iterative arrays. Cellular 
              automata have found application in various areas, including physics, theoretical biology and microstructure modeling.</p>
          <p>A cellular automaton consists of a regular grid of cells, each in one of a finite number of states, such as on and off 
              (in contrast to a coupled map lattice). The grid can be in any finite number of dimensions. For each cell, a set of cells called its 
              neighborhood is defined relative to the specified cell. An initial state (time t = 0) is selected by assigning a state for each cell.
               A new generation is created (advancing t by 1), according to some fixed rule (generally, a mathematical function) that determines 
               the new state of each cell in terms of the current state of the cell and the states of the cells in its neighborhood. Typically, the 
               rule for updating the state of cells is the same for each cell and does not change over time, and is applied to the whole grid simultaneously, 
               though exceptions are known.</p>
          <p>CA is used in a variety of fields, including biology, chemistry, computer processing, cryptography, and modelling physical reality. </p>

          <h2 id="turing">Analyzing Turing Completeness of Conway's Game of Life</h2>
          <p>In computability theory, a system of data-manipulation rules (such as a computer's instruction set, a programming language, or a cellular automaton) 
              is said to be Turing-complete or computationally universal if it can be used to simulate any Turing machine. </p>
          <p>A Turing machine is a mathematical model of computation that defines an abstract machine, which manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules. Despite the model's simplicity, given any computer algorithm, a Turing machine capable of simulating that algorithm's logic can be constructed.</p>
          <p>This means that this system is able to recognize or decide other data-manipulation rule sets. Turing completeness is used as a way to express the power of such a data-manipulation rule set. Virtually all programming languages today are Turing-complete. The concept is named after English mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing.</p>

          <h2>Using Double Buffering to Create the Game</h2>
          <p>There's a technique that's commonly used in graphics programming called double buffering. This is when we display one buffer to the user, but do work on one that's hidden from sight. In this way, the user doesn't see the buffer being generated, they only see the one that was previously completed.</p>
        <p>When we're done doing work on the hidden buffer, we page flip and show the hidden buffer to the user. Then the previously-displayed buffer becomes the new hidden buffer, and work begins again.</p>

        <h2>About John Conway</h2>
        <p>John Horton Conway (December 26, 1937 - April 11, 2020) was an English mathematician 
            acitive in the theory of finite groups, knot theory, number theory, combinatorial game theory and
            coding theory. He made several contributions to the field of mathematics. </p>
        <p>Conway was born and raised in Liverpool, England. He worked first at the University of Cambridge, 
            then moved to the United States where he worked at Princeton University.
