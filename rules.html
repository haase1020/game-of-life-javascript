          Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by
          underpopulation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next
          generation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by
          overpopulation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell,
          as if by reproduction.
